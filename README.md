### Intro to Networking..
Networking, also known as computer networking, is the practice of transporting and exchanging data between nodes over a shared medium in an information system. Networking comprises not only the design, construction and use of a network, but also the management, maintenance and operation of the network infrastructure, software and policies.

Computer networking enables devices and endpoints to be connected to each other on a local area network (LAN) or to a larger network, such as the internet or a private wide area network (WAN). This is an essential function for service providers, businesses and consumers worldwide to share resources, use or offer services, and communicate. Networking facilitates everything from telephone calls to text messaging to streaming video to the internet of things (IoT).
### Components of networking
Computer networking requires the use of physical network infrastructure -- including switches, routers and wireless access points -- and the underlying firmware that operates such equipment. Other components include the software necessary to monitor, manage and secure the network.

Additionally, networks rely on the use of standard protocols to uniformly perform discrete functions or communicate different types of data, regardless of the underlying hardware.

For example, voice over IP (VoIP) can transport IP telephony traffic to any endpoint that supports the protocol. HTTP provides a common way for browsers to display webpages. The internet protocol suite, also known as TCP/IP, is a family of protocols responsible for transporting data and services over an IP-based network.
### Why NetPractice
NetPractice is a project made to make you understand IPV4 addressing and subnetting.

IP stands for internet protocol and it means the protocol used to connect between computers.

An ip4v is a 32 bit value that is divided to 4 sub values meaning that we will have 4294967295 address.
